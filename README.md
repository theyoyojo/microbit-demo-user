If your environment is already setup, just the following to download required libraries:

```bash
yotta target bbc-microbit-classic-gcc
yotta install lancaster-university/microbit

```

#### Important note:
In file microbit-demo-root/yotta_modules/microbit_dal/inc/core/MicroBitConfig.h
Change line 199 from:
```
#define MICROBIT_BLE_ENABLED                    1
```
to
```
#define MICROBIT_BLE_ENABLED                    0
```
In order to enable the radio functionality of the device (which is mutually exclusive with bluetooth functionality)


And finally `yotta build` to generate your .hex file.
